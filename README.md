# Team 1 Bot Code
Code for team 1's bot for MSE 2202 2024. This includes being able to drive across the terrain, pick up gems, sort gems, and return to a base station. 
The most recent changes include updates to the sorting system where the bot can use a colour sensor to keep green gems and eject any other colour.
