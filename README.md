# Team 1 Bot Code
Code for team 1's bot for MSE 2202 2024. This includes being able to drive across the terrain, pick up gems, sort gems, and return to a base station.
The drive_system branch provides the iterations of the code used for the drive system, and no other functionalities.
The sorting branch provides the iterations of the code used for the sorting which remained on its own MSEduino board.
The run_cycle branch provides the code for both the drive and pickup functionalities, executed on a single MSEduino board.

Please Note: Some branches have a Team1_Bot file NOT in a folder. This was an error with the beginning of the git repository and there is concern that removing that file will cause issues for our team members' local versions of this repo. Please disregard that file, the relevant code is within a folder called "Team1_Bot".

Additional Note: The final drive system code is designed to accomodate for the board resetting due to the pickup system. For code that is more closely representative to how it would be written without this issue, see the drive_system branch.

Thank you!!
